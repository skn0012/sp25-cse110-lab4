## Part 2

# Questions

1. 3 is printed because there are only 3 elements in 'prices'.
2. 150 is printed because the last value for discountedPrice is 150.
3. 150 is printed because the last value for finalPrice is 150.
4. The function returns [50, 100, 150]. For 100, discountedPrice = 50, finalPrice = (50 * 100) / 100 = 50. For 200, discountedPrice = 100, finalPrice = (100 * 100) / 100 = 100. For 300, discountedPrice = 150, finalPrice = (150 * 100) / 100 = 150. Thus, the function returns [50, 100, 150].
5. The code returns an error because i is defined using 'let' in the for loop and thus, is only defined in the for loop so the program cannot find i.
6. The code returns an error because discountedPrice is defined using 'let' in the for loop and thus, is only defined in the for loop so the program cannot find discountedPrice.
7. 150 is printed because the last value for finalPrice is 150 and is defined for the whole function.
8. The function returns [50, 100, 150]. For 100, discountedPrice = 50, finalPrice = (50 * 100) / 100 = 50. For 200, discountedPrice = 100, finalPrice = (100 * 100) / 100 = 100. For 300, discountedPrice = 150, finalPrice = (150 * 100) / 100 = 150. Thus, the function returns [50, 100, 150]. The use of 'let' to define variables does not affect the calculation of the final array (discounted).
9. The code returns an error because i is defined using 'let' in the for loop and thus, is only defined in the for loop so the program cannot find i.
10. 3 is printed because there are only 3 elements in 'prices' and there is not an attempt to assign a new element to length.
11. The function returns [50, 100, 150]. For 100, discountedPrice = 50. For 200, discountedPrice = 100. For 300, discountedPrice = 150, (150 * 100) / 100 = 150. Thus, the function returns [50, 100, 150]. The use of 'let' and 'const' to define variables does not affect the calculation of the final array (discounted).
